## Solve numerically

 1. 1D [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation) by the [spectral collocation (i.e., pseudospectral) method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collocation_method)
 2. Schrödinger equation for the [particle in a spherically symmetric potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_in_a_spherically_symmetric_potential)
 3. [Kohn-Sham equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohn%E2%80%93Sham_equations) for an atom using [local-density approximation (LDA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local-density_approximation)
